The following things may be surprising:

*   Hard links between files in a backup are not preservedâ€”if you restore the
    backup or mount it using `comeback mount`, files that previously shared the
    same inode will appear as independent files that happen to have the same
    content.

*   Although ownership information is recorded when saving a backup, it is not
    currently restored when restoring a backup and is not exposed through the
    file system when using `comeback mount`. In both cases, the UID and GID
    seen is that of the `comeback` process.

    The ownership information is recorded
    [here][save.dependencyResolver.FindDependencies]. The relevant restore code
    is [here][restore.newVisitor], and fuse file system code is
    [here][comebackfs.NewFileSystem].

*   Only regular files, directories, and symlinks are supported. Devices, named
    pipes, and sockets are not supported.

*   Out of a file's mode bits, the following are supported:

    *   The usual Unix permissions bits (`0777`).
    *   The setuid bit.
    *   The setgid bit.
    *   The sticky bit.

    No other mode bits are supported.
